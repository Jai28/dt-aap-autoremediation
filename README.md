## Dynatrace + Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform : Auto-Remediation
![Sample Problem](img/sample_problem_screenshot.png)

## Requirements:
* Dynatrace SaaS or Managed environment
* Dynatrace API Token with the following permissions: `Read configuration`, `Write configuration`, `Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology`
* Ansible Automation Platform with Controller instance
* GitHub repository forked from this repository
* GitHub Personal Access Token

## Deployment and Setup:
### Automated Deployment Using Ansible Controller
Most of the setup can be automated using Ansible Controller with the included `deploy-dynatrace-autoremediation.yml` playbook.

#### Organization
The integration should be deployed within an Organization.  Choose one, or create a new one.  Note the Organization id in the address bar (`/#/organizations/{id}/details`).

#### Credentials
Create a Github Personal Access token before you create a project (`/#/credentials/4/details`).

#### Project
Create a new Project for the integration within the Organization.  The Project connects to your (forked) Git repository.  Youâ€™ll need Source Control Credential set up with your (GitHub) Personal Access Token for authentication.  After creation, note the Project id in the address bar (`#/projects/{id}/details`).

#### Inventory
The integration (and automated deployment) should be executed by your Ansible Controller host (only run on 1 host).  Create an Inventory within the Organization.  Add the Ansible Controller host to the inventory.

In order to execute on your Ansible Controller host, you'll need a Machine Credential (SSH user+key).  Create one if it doesn't already exist.

#### Job Template
Create a new Job Template within the Organization.  Select the Inventory, Project, and Credential from the previous steps.  Choose the `deploy-dynatrace-autoremediation.yml` playbook.

Add the required Variables to the Job Template.  Change the values accordingly to match the specifications of your environment.

**hosts_group**: "" # host name or inventory group for the ansible controller\
**ansible_controller_api_host**: "" # host name or ip address for the ansible controller providing the REST API\
**ansible_controller_api_user**: "" # ansible controller user name with permissions to create ansible objects via REST API\
**ansible_controller_api_password**: "" # ansible controller user password\
**ansible_controller_organization**: 1 # ansible controller organization integer id this job template is part of\
**ansible_controller_project**: 1 # ansible controller project integer id this job template is part of\
**ansible_controller_playbook**: "dt-ansible-autoremediation-playbook.yml" # ansible playbook yml to deploy\
**credentials_ansible_username**: "dt-aap-autoremediation-user" # ansible controller user created to execute the job template\
**credentials_ansible_password**: "changeme" # ansible controller user password, should be changed manually after testing\
**credentials_dynatrace_url**: "https://abc123.live.dynatrace.com/api" # dynatrace base api url\
**credentials_dynatrace_token**: "dt0c01.XYZ" # dynatrace api token with sufficient permissions\

#### Manual Steps Required
A few steps are not automated at this time, perform these steps manually.

Edit the `dynatrace-ansible-autoremediation` Job Template.  Add the Machine Credential and two new Credentials.  Change the Variable values accordingly to match the specifications of your environment.
